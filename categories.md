# Speedrun Categories

## Main Categories
These are the most commonly run categories, and as a result have the most information available. You can find most of it on speedrun.com, but bear in mind that not all resources are kept up-to-date with route changes. When in doubt, don't hesitate to ask questions on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/EARy4Eb).

### LA
#### [Warpless](/categories/warpless)
Warpless (or Any% Warpless) is the only commonly run category for Link's Awakening. It follows its own ruleset which disallows [wrong warping](/glitches/wrongwarp), [screen wrapping](/glitches/screenwrap), and [superswimming](/glitches/superswim), as well as restricting [out-of-bounds](/rules/oob) movement.

You can find a Warpless guide by aulos [here](https://www.speedrun.com/la/guide/9s7bt).

### LADX
LADX tends to be more popular than LA for speedrunning, and as a result has multiple main categories. xandertje10 has written a guide that covers all three, which can be found [here](https://www.speedrun.com/ladx/guide/0w2li).

#### [Any% (No WW/OOB)](/categories/wwoob)
Any% (No WW/OOB) (or WWOOB) follows the no [wrong warp](/glitches/wrongwarp)/no [out-of-bounds](/rules/oob) ruleset, common to all of the main LADX categories, as well as several others. Presently this is the most popular category, and is most common for casual races.

You can find a video tutorial by spicefather [here](https://www.speedrun.com/ladx/guide/prsgd).

#### [Any% (No S+Q/WW/OOB)](/categories/sqwwoob)
Any% (No S+Q/WW/OOB) (or SQWWOOB) follows the same rules as WWOOB with the additional restriction of disallowing saving and quitting (as well as resetting or deathwarping). This results in a slightly different route which includes planning for Piece of Power drops beyond the one WWOOB collects in D3.

A video tutorial by xandertje10 can be found [here](https://www.speedrun.com/ladx/guide/30429), along with a Spanish guide by vlackSR [here](https://www.speedrun.com/ladx/guide/aklf7).

#### [100% (No WW/OOB)](/categories/hundo)
100% (No WW/OOB) once again follows the WWOOB ruleset, as well as requiring the collection of several items and upgrades.

A very outdated video tutorial by Cransoon can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQab5Uywf5_LVjW5bRVl7ugwYmAOw7Dlm), but Xander's guide, along with watching recent runs, is recommended instead.
